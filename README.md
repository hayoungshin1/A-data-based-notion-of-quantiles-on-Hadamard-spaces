# A-data-based-notion-of-quantiles-on-Hadamard-spaces
Code for the paper 'A data-based notion of quantiles on Hadamard spaces'.

hypfunctions.py has the functions for the experiments on hyperbolic space and hypexperiments.py has the experiments themselves. spdfunctions.py has the functions for the experiments on the space of symmetric positive-definite matrices, spddata.py has the data and code for its visualization, more or less taken verbatim from https://docs.dipy.org/stable/examples_built/reconstruction/reconst_dti.html#sphx-glr-download-examples-built-reconstruction-reconst-dti-py, and spdexperiments.py has the experiments themselves.
